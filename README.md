# What to Cook (Frontend)

# Link to Project on GH Pages

# Description 
This project has a search bar on the main page where you can type in 
ingredients that you have, and you'll be redirected to a page with some
recipes to cook. If you click on a recipe, a modal will open with ingredients
required.

There is also an 'About' and 'Favorites' page.

# Things to Add in the Future
In the future, I would add functionality to favorite a recipe. Once you like a recipe, it would be added to your favorites page. I would also add user authentication to store your favorites in a backend database. 

I could also add a calendar page where you could put your favorite meals into your calendar and plan out what you are going to cook for the week. 

Spoonacular is a great API with tons of information available. I could add more about the nutritional information of each meal, as well as cooking instructions.
